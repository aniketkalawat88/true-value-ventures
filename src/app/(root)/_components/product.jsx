      "Rapeseed meal or canola meal, a byproduct obtained after the extraction of oil from the rapeseed plant, is widely used as animal feed due to its high protein and nutritional value. Its demand is anticipated to grow significantly amid the growing need for high-protein animal feed ingredients. Rapeseed meal is becoming an ideal replacement for other protein sources like soybean meal due to its high protein content. Increasing livestock production, rising per capita meat consumption, and its cost-effectiveness further fuel its demand.",
